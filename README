This was an academic task from "Compilers" class. We should implement an 
really simple compiler with lexical and syntactic analyzers for an 
pseudocode language. It includes an tradutor from this pseudocode to 
Pascal. I didn't found the specification of this language, but I guess, 
beside the beginner's codification, this could be useful for someone 
who's starting to study how compilers work. As all other academic codes, 
all strings are in brazillian portuguese (no internacionalization).

I'm submitting with the eclipse project structure, so, to run, just 
checkout the project folder into your eclipse's workspace, go to 
"Import -> Existing Project Into Workspace" and select its folder. The 
main class is Form.java.

Good luck!
